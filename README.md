notes

- refactor calls in components, move them to providers or actions
- some refactor in style components for sure
- finish all typescript types, I add any just to compile

tests:
- check that functions and lines are covered with jest --coverage
- for every component add a snapshot
- write specs for components that have logic
- write tests for all the providers
- write acceptance tests with jest, click a button, expect a text that appears
- use react-testing-library from kent. c. doods for the tests

- improve the code in general, that was quickly written

to be done:
- add action cable library so that user does not refresh page after every move
- improve style
